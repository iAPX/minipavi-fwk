Responsability : demonstrate the main features of MiniPaviFwk, and have copy-pastable working code

Source directory : [services/demo/](../../services/demo/)


## The Demo Minitel Service


## The code itself

Coding Standard is PSR-12, as for the MiniPaviFwk, with a twist...

The code is meant to be looked at, and also copy-pasted the way you see fit!
That explains the choice of not putting `use` statements, to instead use full namepace paths; it wildly simplify copy-pasting the demo code into your own (wherever it will be) to do simple tests while learning about its usages and testing your work.

Don't hesitate to play with it, I recommend to use `git clone` to access the whole project, and to use GIT locally or with your own GIT server/provider to be able to `git diff` at any point, rollback your modifications. GIT is your friend!
